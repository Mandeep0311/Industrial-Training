    <h1> HUMAN INTELLIGENCE VS ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE </h1>
    <img src="Image.jpg" alt="AI vs HI Picture">
    <p> When looking at AI vs human writing, AI is great for creating content quickly. It can write a lot of text fast, making it useful for tasks like product descriptions. However, human writers bring creativity and emotion that AI can't match</p>
    <h2>Human Intelligence:</h2>
    <P>Human intelligence or the behavior of the human being has come from past experiences and the doings based upon situation, and environment. And it is completely based upon the ability to change his/her surroundings through knowledge which we gained.
    <br> 
    It gives diverse sorts of information. It can provide data on things related to a particular aptitude and knowledge, which can be another human subject, or, within the case of locators and spies, diplomatic data which they had to get to. So, after concluding all it can give data on interpersonal connections and arrange of interest.</P>
    <h2>Advantages of Human Intelligence</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li>Human intelligence has creativity, intuition, and emotional intelligence that AI lacks.</li>
        <li>Human intellience can adapt to new and unexpected situations.</li>
        <li>Human Intelligencce can provide ethical and moral considerations in decision-making. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Disadvanyages of Human Intelligence </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Human Intelligence is limited by its physical and mental capabilities.</li>
        <li>Human Intelligence is prone to biases and may make errors or poor decisions.</li>
        <li>Human Intelligencce requires rest and breaks, which can slow down processes.</li>
    </ul>
<h2> Artifical Intelligence: </h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is based on human insights that can be decided in a way that can machine can effortlessly actualize the tasks, from the basic to those that are indeed more complex. The reason for manufactured insights is learning, problem-solving, reasoning, and perception. This term may be connected to any machines which show related to a human intellect such as examination and decision-making and increments the efficiency. AI covers assignments like robotics, control systems, face recognition, scheduling, data mining, and numerous others. </p>
<h2>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<ul> 
    <li>AI can process vast amounts of data much faster than humans</li>
    <li>AI can work around the clock without needing breaks or rest.</li>
    <li>AI can perform tasks that are too dangerous or difficult for humans.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Disadvanyages of Artifical Intelligencce</h2>
<ul>
    <li>AI lacks the creativity and intuition that humans possess.</li>
    <li>AI is limited by its programming and may not be able to adapt to new or unexpected situations.</li>
    <li>AI may make errors if not programmed and trained properly.</li>
   </ul>
